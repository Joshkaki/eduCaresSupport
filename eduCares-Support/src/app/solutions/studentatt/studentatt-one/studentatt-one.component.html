                <h2>
                    What is Marking and tracking student attendance?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Marking and tracking student attendance is very important. It helps evaluate the institution’s
                    quality, make timely administrative and financial decisions, and plan events such as fire drills and
                    other institution activities. Knowing your student attendance will also help identify trends and
                    give the institution the necessary data to establish an action plan to change the attendance culture
                    of an individual student or a group of students.

                    <br> <br> The<b> Attendance</b> module is designed to help teachers
                    easily mark student attendance during class. EduCares automatically considers all students as
                    ‘Present’, so only students who do not attend class must be marked ‘Absent’. Students can be marked
                    absent for half the day (Forenoon or Afternoon) or for the full day. Teachers may also provide the
                    reason for a student’s absence. The optional ‘Rapid Attendance’ feature allows teachers to mark
                    attendance quickly without the need to provide the reason for a student’s absence. When a student is
                    marked absent, a SMS notification is sent (if set up) to the student and the emergency contact of
                    the student.

                    <br><br><b> Note:</b> To set up SMS notifications, see the<b> EduCares User Guide for Communication
                        Tools.</b>
                    <br> Attendance reports can be generated for each batch to help teachers track and monitor student
                    attendance. Students can see their own attendance record for the current year from their EduCares
                    login.
                    <br> If your institution marks student attendance<b> Subject-wise,</b> make sure to create a
                    timetable for each batch to be able to mark student attendance.
