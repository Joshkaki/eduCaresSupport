                <p>

                    At the time of admitting an employee, you may need to record the employee’s bank details such as
                    account number, the name of the bank, or any other additional information required by the
                    institution. According to your institution’s requirement, you may add any number of custom fields
                    that are required which will then be displayed in employee admission form.
