                    How can I add custom fields to record additional employee admission details?
                </h2>
                <p>

                    At the time of admitting an employee, the employee admission form will capture the employee details
                    using the default fields available. Apart from the default fields, you can add custom fields that
                    can be used to record any additional details about the employee.

                    <br><br>At the top of your dashboard, click the module access icon ><b> Administration > Human
                        Resource
                        > Setting > Add Additional Detail </b>to open the <b>Additional Details</b> page.
