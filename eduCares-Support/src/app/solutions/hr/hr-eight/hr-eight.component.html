                    How can I add an employee grade?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most institutions use grades to compare roles within their institutional structure and also to
                    relate compensation. In Educares, employee grades can be used to represent seniority of employees
                    within the institution, and to define the number of periods an employee of a particular grade should
                    teach or work. In relevance to your institution, you can create as many employee grades as you like.

                    <br><br>At the top of your dashboard, click the module access icon > <b>Administration > Human
                        Resource > Setting > Add Employee Grade</b> to open the<b> Add grade </b>page.
