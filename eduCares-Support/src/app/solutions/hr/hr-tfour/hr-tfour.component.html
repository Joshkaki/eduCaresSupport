                    How can we create payroll group in Educares?
                </h2>
                <p>

                    Payroll is handled by payroll groups in Educares. The payroll groups define the payroll structure of
                    an employee based on the payroll categories added to the group. Sometimes a single payroll schedule
                    may not fit the requirements of an institution. You can create different payroll groups, to group
                    employees who have a common payroll structure, payment frequency, and LOP calculation method. Each
                    payroll group created must be processed separately.

                        the condition is not met (‘Default condition’). You can add as many IF conditions as you want.
