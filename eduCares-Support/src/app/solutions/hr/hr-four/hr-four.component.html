                    An educational institution may have different career progression paths for teaching staff,
                    non-teaching staff, and other employee categories. For example, teaching staff may progress from
                    being a “Lecturer” to a “Reader” to a “Professor”, while non-teaching staff may progress from being
                    a "Clerk" to an "Accountant". In relevance to your institution, you can create as many employee
                    positions as you like.
