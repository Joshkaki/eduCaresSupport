                    An educational institution may have various departments. For example, an engineering college may
                    have departments such as Electrical Sciences, Mechanical Sciences, and so on. Additionally,
                    institutions can have departments such as Library, Finance, and so on. In relevance to your
                    institution, you can create many different departments as you like.
