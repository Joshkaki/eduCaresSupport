                    How can we add payroll category in Educares?
                </h2>
                <p>

                    The employee payroll is made up of many components and the components are named as <b>payroll
                        category</b> in Educares. It can have variable values based on formulas and conditions. The formulas for each
                    payroll category can be dependent on other categories.

                    <br> <br> In Educares, payroll categories are grouped into two types: <b>Earnings</b> and<b>
                        Deductions.</b>
                    <br> Earnings are all amounts paid to an employee for services rendered on an hourly, salary, or any
                    other basis. For example, Basic Salary, Bonus, and so on.

                    <br> <br> <b>Deductions</b> are amounts withheld by the institution. For example, Provident Fund,
                    Professional Tax, Income Tax, and so on.

                    <br> <br> The payroll amount for a category can have numeric values or variable values based on
                    formulas and conditions. For example, a payroll category ‘Basic’ can have the calculation rule as
                    ‘40%GROSS’.

                        condition is not met (‘Default condition’). You can add as many IF conditions as you want.
