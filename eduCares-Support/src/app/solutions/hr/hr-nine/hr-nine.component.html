                <p>
                    If you do not want an employee grade to be displayed in the employee admission form, you can
                    inactivate it or delete it. However, you cannot inactivate or delete an employee grade that has
                    already been assigned to an employee (if it has some dependency).

                    <br><br>At the top of your dashboard, click the module access icon > <b>Administration > Human
                        Resource > Setting > Add Employee Grade</b> to open the<b> Add grade </b>page.
