                    How to archive or delete an employee account?
                </h2>
                <p>

                    When archiving or deleting an employee account, the following two options will be available:

                </p>
                <ul class="parahone">
                    <li> <b> Employee leaving the institution </b>– Use this option to archive and move the employee
                        from the active employee list to the archived/former employee list.
                        <br> Note: Unlike students, archived employee accounts cannot be reverted and made active.
                    <li> <b> Remove employee records </b>– Use this option to delete all the information associated with
                        the employee. Once deleted, the employee account cannot be restored.
                        <br> You cannot delete an employee account that has dependencies in other Educares modules. You
                        will have to first remove the dependencies, and then delete the employee account. However, there
                        are certain dependencies that cannot be removed. For example, if the employee has approved pay
                        slips. In such cases, the employee account cannot be deleted.

                </ul>
                <ol class="parahone">
                    <li> At the top of your dashboard, click the module access icon > <b>Administration > User</b> to
                        open the <b>Manage Users page.</b>
                    <li> Search for the user and when you find the employee, click on the employee’s name. Basic
                        details of the employee’s profile is displayed.
                    <li> Click the <b>View Profile</b> button to view the employee’s complete profile.
                    <li> In the top right, click the <b>Delete</b> button.

                        <br> The <b>Remove employee</b> page is displayed.

                        <br> <img style="margin-left: 20px;" src="..\..\assets\Solutions\HR\19.2.jpg" alt="19.2">

                    <li> Select one of the options.
                        <br> If you want to archive the employee account, select the <b>Employee leaving the
                            institution</b> option. You must specify the reason for the employee leaving, and then click the <b>Delete
                        </b>button.

                        <br> <img style="margin-left: 20px;" src="..\..\assets\Solutions\HR\19.3.jpg" alt="19.3">

                        <br> If you want to permanently delete the employee account, select the <b>Remove employee
                            records</b> option. A confirmation message is displayed. Click <b>OK</b> to confirm removal.

                </ol>
