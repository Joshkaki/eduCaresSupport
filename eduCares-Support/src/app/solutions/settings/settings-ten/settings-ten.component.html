                    What is the use of Active, Inactive or Delete field in admission additional details?
                </h2>

                <p> If an <b>additional field</b> is active it will be displayed in the admission form, and if we do not
                    want a
                    custom admission detail field to be displayed in the student admission form, we can
                    <b>inactivate</b> it or
                    <b>delete</b> it. However, we cannot delete a custom admission detail field that has already been
                    used to
                    record student details.
                </p>

                    At the top of your dashboard, click the Menu > <b>Administration > Settings > Add Admission
                        Additional
                        Details</b> to open the <b>Add additional details </b>page.
