                    How to allocate different subject for different students on same period?
                </h2>

                <p>

                    In Educares, you can create a timetable that has more than one subject at same time period. You can
                    also assign different students to these different subjects. For an instance, Let's assume that
                    'standard 3' students are divided into two groups and planning to conduct 'Library' for Group 1 and
                    'Debate class' for Group 2, then you can create a timetable as given below.

                </p>

                <img style="width: 60%;" src="..\..\assets\Solutions\Timetable\23.2.jpg" alt="23.2">
                <p>
                    In the next period you can also conduct these classes by interchanging the groups. That is,
                    'Library' for Group 2 and 'Debate class' for Group 1.
                    <br><br> You can do these in Educares by following the given steps.

                </p>
                <ol class="parahone">
                    <li> Go to<b> Menu > Administration > Settings > Manage subjects.</b> Then select the course and
                        batch. Click ‘+ Elective group’ and create elective group with any meaningful name (Activities).
                    <li> Add the subjects in your elective group in which you wanted to conduct classes in same
                        period. You can do this by clicking ‘+add subject’ option on right side of the row. For example,
                        we will add 'Library' (Group 1) and 'Debate class' (Group 2).

                            alt="23.3">

                    <li> Assign the batch students as per the subjects you made by clicking the ‘assign student’
                        option on right side of the row. In next page you will get option to assign the students to
                        current subject.

                        <img style="width: 60%; margin-left: 20px;" src="..\..\assets\Solutions\Timetable\23.4.jpg"
                            alt="23.4">

                        <br> The steps 4 and 5 are required only if you are planning to make a separate time table by
                        interchanging the students.
                    <li> Create the next elective group with a meaningful name (Example LAB 2).

                        <img style="width: 60%; margin-left: 20px;" src="..\..\assets\Solutions\Timetable\23.5.jpg"
                            alt="23.5">

                    <li> Add the subjects into the elective groups and then assign the students who were not assigned
                        to this subject at the first time. In our case we will add Library (for Group 2') and Debate
                        class (for Group 1').

                    <li> Create the timetable, now you can select elective group into the required time period. This
                        elective group will contain different subjects with different students. Make sure that you have
                        done employee subject allocation before starting timetable creation.
                </ol>
                <p>
                    This method will also help you to manage the exam and to enter the marks for this Subjects.
