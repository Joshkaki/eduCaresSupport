                    How can I set weekdays and assign a class timing set to each weekday?
                </h2>

                <p>
                    Weekdays are days on which classes are planned for a batch. For a newly added batch, by default,
                    Monday to Friday are set as weekdays. You can edit the default weekdays.
                </p>
                <ol class="parahone">
                    <li>  At the top of your dashboard, click the module access icon > <b>Academics > Timetable > Set
                        weekdays & class timing sets</b> to open the Set weekdays & class timing sets page.

                    <li>  If you want to change the weekdays for a batch, select a course, and then select the batch
                        and make the changes.
                      <br> <b> Note:</b> You must select at least one weekday.
                    <li>  Click <b>Change,</b> and then assign a class timing set for each weekday.

                    <li>  In the Applicable from field, select the starting date of the batch if this is your first
                        time setting the weekdays and class timing sets. If you are editing weekdays and class timing sets
                        for an existing timetable, in the Applicable from field, select the date from which you want the
                        changes to be applied.
                        You cannot change weekdays for which attendance has been previously marked.
