                    How do I create timetables for two different duration of completion?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Here is how you can create timetables:
                  <br>  <br> Timetables in Educares are created for all courses in the institution at once. So here you have
                    to select the course that has the least duration among the two.
                </p>

                <ul class="parahone">
                    <li> Create a timetable for the course Y i.e for three months and assign the subjects for
                        different periods.
                    <li> In a similar way, for course X also assign subjects in the same timetable.
                    <li> Then after 3 months, create a new timetable for course Y for the next trimester and one for
                        course X for the same semester (keeping the subject entries same as the previous timetable).
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This workaround can be followed for institutions that have 2 or more duration timings. Every time
                    the least duration has to be followed while creating a timetable.
