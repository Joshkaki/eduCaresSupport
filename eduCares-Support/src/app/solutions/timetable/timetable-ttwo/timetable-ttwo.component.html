                    How to assign or unassign a batch to an existing timetable?
                </h2>

                <p>

                    A batch can be assigned to an existing timetable only if weekdays and class timings sets have been
                    created for the batch. Similarly, a batch can be unassigned from a timetable only if subject entries
                    have not been created in the timetable for that batch.

                </p>
