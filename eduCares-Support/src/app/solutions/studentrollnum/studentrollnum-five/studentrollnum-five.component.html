                    How do I assign student roll numbers during admission?
                </h2>

                <p>
                    When admitting a student, you can assign the student roll number under the<b> Course & Batch Details
                    </b> section of the admission form. Together with a prefix, student roll number can be a maximum of
                    twelve characters and can contain numbers, letters, hyphens, and underscores.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Student roll numbers do not get auto-incremented with every new student admitted, so they must be
                    entered manually. Also, make sure to enter a unique roll number for each student. Two students of a
                    batch cannot be assigned a same roll number.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you've set a roll number prefix for the batch as mentioned here, the prefix is also displayed, as
                    seen in the image below.

                <p>
                    If you've not set a roll number prefix for the batch, a hyphen is displayed, as seen in the image
                    below.

                    <b>
                        Note : </b>Though two different courses or two different batches can have the same roll number
                    prefix, we
                    recommend setting a unique roll number prefix for each course and batch to avoid any confusion. The
                    roll
                    number prefix for students cannot be individually edited.
