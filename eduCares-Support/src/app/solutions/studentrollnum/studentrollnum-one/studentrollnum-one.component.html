                    What is student roll number? What is the advantage of assigning roll numbers?
                </h2>

                <p>Roll numbers are unique identification numbers that can be assigned to students at the time of
                    admission or after admission. Roll numbers are unique to students within a batch. Two students of a
                    batch cannot be assigned the same roll number.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To avoid instances of students of different batches having the same roll numbers, you can set a
                    common prefix to all student roll numbers of each batch. The prefix can help you to identify which
                    course and batch a student belongs to.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Before assigning roll numbers, you must choose how students are to be sorted in your institution.
                    Students can be sorted by <b>Admission no., First Name, </b>or <b>Last Name.</b> After sorting the
                    students, the
                    first step is to set a prefix for a course. The prefix set for a course is automatically applied to
                    all batches under that course. Also applied to all students in each batch. If you do not want all
                    batches of a course to have the same roll number prefix, you can change it for each batch. Though
                    two different courses or two different batches can have the same roll number prefix, we recommend
                    setting a unique roll number prefix for each course and batch to avoid any confusion. The roll
                    number prefix for students cannot be individually edited.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Note:-</b><br> <b>Administrator</b> or a <b>privileged employee (Manage student roll numbers</b>
                    privilege must be
                    provided) can assign and manage student roll numbers.
