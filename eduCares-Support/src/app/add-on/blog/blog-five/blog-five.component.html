                    How a blog admin can ban blog as well as delete a blog comment?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user with 'Blog Admin' privilege can make a <b>'Blog post'<b> or </b>'Comment'</b> banned. Also a
                    user who post
                    a blog or comment on a blog post can delete their respective post or comment. Also a user with Blog
                    Admin privilege can mark the comment or post as spam. Refer the figures below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Give Blog Admin privilege for user. (Go to manage users, select the user and click on Edit
                    Privilege)
                </p>
                <img src="..\..\assets\Add-On\Blog\5.1.jpg" alt="5.1">
                <p>
                    Select the <b>'Blog Admin'</b> privilege. Now this user will be able to mark the blog post or
                    comment as spam.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the user logs in, the user will be able to see the Blog posts if the user clicks on the blog
                    module.
                </p>
                <img src="..\..\assets\Add-On\Blog\5.2.jpg" alt="5.2">
                <p>
                    Click on the blog post and the Blog Admin can see the spam link at the top right corner.
                </p>
                <img src="..\..\assets\Add-On\Blog\5.3.jpg" alt="5.3">
                <p>
                    Once the blog post is marked as banned, only the user with Blog Admin privilege can un-ban the post.
                    Once the post is banned no user can see the post.
                </p>
