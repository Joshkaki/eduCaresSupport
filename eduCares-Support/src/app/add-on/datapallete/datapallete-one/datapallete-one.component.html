                    The EduCares institution dashboard is a collection of dashlets that give you an overview of
                    important information for a specific date, generated from its complementary page. The dashlets let
                    you monitor the progress of your institution. You can easily rearrange the dashlets using
                    drag-and-drop, and you can also choose the dashlets you want to display on the dashboard.

                    To provide a more interactive user experience, the Data Palette also contain links, so when a user
                    clicks the link, the appropriate information is displayed based on the userâ€™s roles and privileges
                    allowing the user to act immediately.<br>
                    The following table describes the links available on each dashlet that can used to assess
                    corresponding information based on user roles.
