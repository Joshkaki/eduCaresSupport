                <p>
                    If you go to return book link, and search for the book number to be returned, then the book issue
                    details will be shown. If the due date is already exceeded a message such as ‘Due date has been
                    exceeded’ will be displayed and the user will be asked to enter the fine amount. By entering the
                    fine amount and clicking on return, the book can be returned.
