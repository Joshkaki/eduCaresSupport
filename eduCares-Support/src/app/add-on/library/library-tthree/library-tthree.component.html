                    How librarian can set maximum number of books issued to a student?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Librarian can set maximum number of books Issued to a student using the Library Settings. In Library
                    Setting you will be able to set the maximum number of books that can be issued to students based on
                    the student category. There may some students under a student category who would have privilege to
                    take more books than others. This setting can be done from here. For example: A user can set the
                    maximum number of books that can issued for a particular course and the time period for books that
                    can be issued for a particular category of students. By using the following the below steps the
                    books can be issued to a student category under Library.
