                    How can I add books in library?
                </h2>

                <p>

                    When adding a book to your library, you have the option to use a barcode reader and scan the book
                    for the barcode number. We suggest using a barcode reader because the reader will speed up the
                    process of searching, issuing, renewing and collecting the books.
                </p>
