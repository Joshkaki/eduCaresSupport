                    How I can reserve a book in Library?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A book can be reserved by a student or employee only if its status is <b>Available, Borrowed or
                        Binding.</b> A book with the status <b>Lost</b> cannot be reserved. Though a book can be
                    reserved, this can be issued to another student or an employee only by the Administrator or
                    Librarian (employee with
                    <b>Librarian</b> privilege).
                </p>
