                <h2>
                    What is the use of barcode integration in the library module?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Educares is equipped with Barcode Integration which can help you deal with library management in
                    your institution. Any new book addition, book issued or returned by students can be entered. Be it a
                    renewal or the search for a book to know its status can be easily done by the scanning the Barcode
                    of the books. Managing your institution’s library is much easier now with barcode integration.

                    <br><br> <b>Scenario 1: When a new book is added</b>

                    <br><br> When a new book is added, go to ‘Manage Books’ in the home page of library and then select
                    ‘Add books’.

                    <br> There will two ‘Book addition mode’- ‘General’ and ‘By barcode’. Thus, you can add a new book
                    in your library using the barcode of the book.

                    <br><br> <b>Scenario 2: When a book is returned/renewed/issued</b>

                    <br><br> The barcode integration can also be used in case a book is issued from the library,
                    returned or
                    renewed. You can keep a track of all the entries with help of the barcode in the book.

                    <br><br> For issuing a book, go to ‘Issue books’ in ‘Library Management’ and use the barcode to do
                    the need.

                    <br> In case of returning a book, go to ’Return Book’ in ‘Library Management’ page. Store the
                    returned
                    book using the barcode.

                    <br>  <img style="margin-left: 20px;" src="..\..\assets\Add-On\Library\14.3.jpg" alt="14.3">

                    <br> For renewal, go to ‘Book renewal’ in ‘Library Management’ page and use the barcode of the book
                    for
                    book renewal.
                    <br>     <img style="margin-left: 20px;" src="..\..\assets\Add-On\Library\14.4.jpg" alt="14.4">

                    <br>
                    The barcode integration can also be used to search for books in your library. Use the barcode of
                    books to look for the current status of a particular book, whether its available or reserved by
                    someone for later issue. For this, go to ‘Search book’ in ‘Library management’ and use the barcode
                    of the book to know the status.
